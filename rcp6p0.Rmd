RCP 6.0 is a scenario that assumes moderate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in a moderate level of warming and moderate sea level rise.

Below you can view the absolute and relative change maps. Check the [Map Description](map_description.html) for information about the creation of the map, especially the creation of the bins. 
Below the maps you can download a high resolution pdf for each map.

### Absolute Change under RCP 6.0
```{r, echo = F, warning = F, out.width = "100%"}
leaflet_function(absolute_tifs[2], "Absolute PFY Change")
```

However, cells that have a lot of agricultural production will exhibit large absolute changes even under small relative changes and vice versa. Therefore it is important to simultaneously take the growth rate into account.

### Relative Change under RCP 6.0
```{r, echo = F, warning = F, out.width="100%"}
leaflet_function(relative_tifs[2], "Growth Rate")
