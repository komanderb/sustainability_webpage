## About the project

Some random text describing what we did and why


## About the data

For a full overview of the methodology, check out the [model documentation](link). 
Essentially for cell i, we have the harvesting area of crop c under water conditions w (either rainfed or irrigated) denoted as $har_{icw}$. The data is taken from [GAEZv4](https://gaez.fao.org/) for the year 2010. 
Moreover GAEZv4 provides data on the agro-climatic potential yield for crop *c* in cell *i* for today (observed) and future time periods (estimated). 
For future time periods the estimation/simulation is subject to the assumed climatic conditions of one of the four Relative Concentration Pathways. (Read more about them here). Thus agro-climatic potential yield is defined as $\gamma_{icw}$ for todays production and as $\gamma_{icwst}$ for future production where s denotes the RCP and t the time period. 

In order to compare future scenarios with todays production, we multiply the harvesting area of crop c in cell i with the corresponding agro-climatic yield for crop c in cell i

$$ \theta_{icwst} = \gamma_{icwst} \times har_{icw} $$

Note that this differs from actual production through yield gaps (read more here). 
Also the construction of $\theta_{icwst}$ shows the two major assumptions of our approach

1. High Input Management Assumption
2. Constant harvesting area, i.e. no crop adaptation


The first assumption is predetermined by the agro-climatic potential yield data. It assumes high input management (what exactly is that). As this assumptions holds for today's and future data, it cancels out, allowing a focus on just the changes of climatic conditions. Denoted constant technology in _Economic Terms_ , we assume that the farming technology and agricultural inputs remain the same over time. Highly unrealistic but this allows the focus on the climatic changes.

The second assumption can be described as _no adaptation of crops_, i.e. farmers don't change their set of crops with changing climatic conditions. 
Theoretically this is a very limiting assumptions, as varying climatic conditions might change in favour to certain crops for specific regions, which make them easier to grow etc.. Yet this again allows to identify regions that _will_ have to adapt the most or benefit the most, as their current composition of harvested crops is unsuitable/suitable. 

Otherwise would need to be integrated into a more complex allocation model.

In order to compare cells with different produced crops, we then aggregate crops in each cell by their caloric yield $ca_c$. 

$$ \theta_{iwst} = \sum_{c = 1}^{C} \theta_{icwst} \times ca_c $$
Now we have one measure for each cell, time period and RCP.


## About the maps

The maps (visible here!) show either the absolute change in calories or the growth rate of calories, where calories are expressed in people fed yearly:
$$\frac{\theta_{iwst}}{365 * c_{min}}$$
where $c_{min}$ is calories needed per person per day. After summing the water supply types, the change measure $\omega$ is defined as:


$$\omega_{ist} = \theta_{ist} - \theta_{i} $$
in the absolute case and 
$$\omega_{ist} = \frac{\theta_{ist} - \theta_{i}}{\theta_i} $$

As mentioned, most of the data is taken from the GAEZv4. Check out their model documentation for detailed information

Additionally this paper interesting for gdp, this paper for population
