RCP 2.6 is a scenario that assumes very aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in a relatively low level of warming and minimal sea level rise.

Below you can view the absolute and relative change maps. Check the [Map Description](index.html) for information about the creation of the map, especially the creation of the bins.

Note that Change relates to differences between the time period 2070-2100 to today. We express calories in People Fed Yearly (**PFY**)
